This edition was customized from Alex Gil's [Ed](https://github.com/minicomp/ed) theme for Jekyll, which uses [minimal computing principles](https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/about/) to keep the website's digital footprint as light as possible. This website is published through Github which is carbon neutral, but currently uses a mix of non-renewable and renewable energy.
